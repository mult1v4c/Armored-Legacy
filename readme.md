<h1 align="center">Armored Legacy Resource Pack</h1>

**Armored Legacy** is a resource pack that revamps vanilla armor, giving it a powerful new look with custom models and textures using [EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) and [ETF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures). It is compatible with animation resource packs and also features glowing armor trims that are compatible with shaders.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compatibility & Usage
This pack requires versions `1.21.2` and above to work as intended with [EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) and [ETF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures) installed.

Resource packs that change all vanilla armor are **NOT** compatible. Mods with custom armors may require compatibility packs. If you'd like to create one, please open a thread in the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/mult1v4c/Armored-Legacy/issues).

Make sure this pack is placed **above** any other resource packs to avoid conflicts.

### Please also check out my other pack [Hardware Reforged](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/hardware-reforged)! Fully compatible with Armored Legacy and is designed to be used together.
