<h1 align="center">Armored Legacy Resource Pack</h1>

**Armored Legacy** is a resource pack that revamps vanilla armor, giving it a powerful new look with custom models and textures using [EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) and [ETF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures). It features vanilla-like armor trims that glow and interchangeable helmets for Copper, Diamond, and Netherite!

## üé® Features

### Armor Trims

Armored Legacy has fully integrated vanilla armor trims to support the custom models.

Glowing trims require versions `1.21.2` until `1.21.8` to work as intended. As of `1.21.9` and above, glowing trims are not working.

### Interchangeable Helmets

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This feature requires [Variants CIT](https://modrinth.com/mod/variants-cit) installed to work properly.**

You can change Copper, Diamond, and Netherite Helmets to change their looks.

Rename **Copper Helmet** to `Copper Goggles On` or `Copper Goggles Off`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compatibility & Usage

This pack works with versions `1.20` until the latest version.

Make sure this pack is placed **above** any other resource packs to avoid conflicts.

Resource packs that change all vanilla armor are **NOT** compatible. Mods with custom armors may require compatibility packs. If you'd like to create one, please open a thread in the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/mult1v4c/Armored-Legacy/issues).

As of version `1.21.9` and above, this pack is **NOT** compatible with any player animation packs such as Fresh Moves, Better Animations, etc. due to changes with vanilla armor configurations.
